    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have a maximum of 300 observations in our training sample, with 48 binary features.  This is definitely not enough data per feature and will play a large part in our choice of algorithm, as mentioned during the discussion on the curse of dimensionality.  However, despite this lack of observations we might still be able to make valuable predictions using the following three algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)  Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB):**\n",
    "\n",
    "GaussianNB has been used successfully in language processing and successful applications include spam filtering.  The following article titled \"A Plan for Spam\" illustrates how to apply the concepts of Bayes theorem for spam detection: http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html.  BernoulliNB is similar in its theory and applications, also being used for document classification or spam filtering; it assumes a Bernoulli rather than Gaussian distribution for the conditional probability relationships.  Furthermore, the bernoulli distribution works well with binary features, such as the features that we have in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes has proven to be a powerful classfication system in practice.  It is relatively fast to train and less affected by irrelevant feature.  Also, it does not require extensive training before making good predictions and performs well in a wide variaty of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cause for concern with the algorithm is the assumption and choice of the distribution which requires intuition and domain knowledge to choose an appropriate one.  Naive bayes also assumes independence of the individual features and may fail to classify correctly when the correlation between the two features affects the classification; for instance, Naive bayes will be unable to predict the XOR relationship between two variables as mentioned in the notes.  In practice, we might still be able to make valuable predictions even in the presence of some dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of all binary features with little training data per feature.  Naive bayes may be able to overcome this lack of data as it does not require significant training data as mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)  Support Vector Machines (SVM):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines have been used successfully for classification in bioinformatics.  Some examples in literature can be found here: http://www.support-vector.net/bioinformatics.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model allows a lot of flexibility in choosing the similarity/kernel, this allows us to use this for many different types of relationships.  It also performans well in high dimensions with a large number of features, even in the presence of small training sets.  Is easy to understand and visualize (in 2 dimensions) with an intuitive foundation of maximizing the margin between the two classes.  The model is a great choice for applications such as bioinformatics, where they are dealing with data in high dimensions with relatively low observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility of selecting a custom kernel can also be a weakness since it requires intuition and knowlege of the domain.  This may be easy in 2 dimensions but can be quite a challenge in higher dimensions.  SVM can also be sensitive to noise, resulting in overfitting to the noise and mislabled data points.  Finally, they are computationally expenseive, both in training and prediction, especially when working with large samples with high number of feature vectors.  As a result, if fast estimation and prediction is required, this is not the best algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we the SVM seems to be a good food especially considering we have a small sample size with a large number of features.  Choice of Kernel may be more difficult to select, but we shall stick with the default for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3)  Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods, including AdaBoost, is being proposed as an effective algorithm for real time facial recognition.  This is discuessed in \"Boosting for Fast Face Recognition\" which can be found here:  http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/boosting-ensemble/ratfg-rts01guo.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of ensemble methods using weak learners include that it is very fast and simple.  Moreover, boosting can be used with any algorithm, even a combination of different algorithms (via voting).  More importantly, boosting using weak learners is resistent to overfitting.  As a result, it is a good fit for the online, fast face recognition technique mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some drawbacks include selection of the underlying algorithm and their respective parameters.  Also, if the learner is too complex then this can lead to overfitting.  Finally, the technique can be senstive to noise and outliers.  As a result, if there are many misclassified data points then this may not be the appropriate technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we shall be using the default DecisionTreeClassifier with a depth of 1 as our base estimator for the AdaBoost model.  This model tackles the problem from an entirely different perspective than the other two and complements our approach.  Finally, using a single level decision tree as the base estimator results in a relatively fast training algorithm that is linear in the number of observations (as opposed to SVM) and may be useful if computation time is an issue.\n"

    "All three models have their relative strengths and weaknesses.  The appropriate model in any scenario depends on the tradeoff between accuracy and time/computation constraints.  In this case, training and prediction time does not seem to be very important since we are working with data that has a very low time frequency, most likely annual observations.  Also, predictions are not needed in real time and it is more important for us to find the the most accurate model with the predictions being used for longer term decision making.  Moreover, even though the training set is expected to increase over time, the schools do not have the capacity to significantly increase the number of students and the training set can be expected to remain relatively small (i.e. won't number in the hundreds of thousands).  Finally, it is possible that the number of features increases in the future as we discover new possible variables that can impact the passing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all of these points, the model that is best suited for this low observation, high dimension data set is the SVM model.  It has similar accuracy to the other training models but we can expect to improve this score after optimization of the parameters.  Unlike the others, we actually have 3 potential parameters to adjust.  Furthermore, the theory also supports the SVM framework for this type of a scenario.\n"

    "The SVM model is based on the simple concept of trying to find a line or border that divides objects in to different types.  For example, the SVM line on a chess board that is setup in the starting position would be the horizontal line in the middle of the board that is equally far away from the white and black pieces.  The reason we choose the middle line, is that it helps classify new points that may show up in to the different categories.  So in our chess example, if new pieces are added to the board the centre line would be better able to split the new pieces if they follow a similar pattern.  If the line was closer to the white pieces for instance, then a new piece that is just outside of this line would be labeled as black and based on the initial setup we would rather assume that things follow the existing order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is even more powerful than that simple example as the dividing line does not have to be a straight line.  Imagine a mall parking lot with the handicap or reserved parking spots being situated closer to the mall while the remainder of spots for the general public located further out.  The two types of parking spots can be separated by a circle and the SVM model is also capable of finding the circle that has the largest distance from both types of spots, this distance is also called 'margin'.  Ofcourse, in reality this can get quite complicated as we start considering more variables but the theory remains the same and the model is always trying to find this separator, whatever form it may take.  As more data points are added, they are classified based on what side of the separator they fall.  This is where finding the largest margin is helpful, as we can be more confident in classifying the new points."

Both of these scores are higher than 0.8421 and 0.7826 for the training and testing scores from the initial untuned model.  The grid search selected a different kernel (rbf) from the initial linear model we tested and also selected a gamma of 0.1 over the default of 0.021 (1/# of features).  The smaller the gamma the more constrained the shape of the separator, so in this case the model is less constrained than the default values.
